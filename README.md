# Workforce-Snapshot
A lightweight API integration demo that simulates Workday RAAS/REST-style data retrieval, transformation, and reporting. Built in Python, this project fetches workforce-style records via REST API, processes JSON data, and outputs HR-usable text and CSV reports—mirroring Workday EIB and integration workflows.
